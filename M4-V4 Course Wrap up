Module 4 Video 4: Course Wrap up
[00:00:00] Hi. OK. So this is the wrap up video for our course on equity and ethics in data
journalism. And you'll remember back at the beginning how we talked about it's important if
you're going to create a data journalism piece that you go through each step of the way in your
data lifecycle and look for the ways that world views and values and ethical situations are being
embedded or not being embedded into each part of your data story. And the parts that we've
paid particular attention to is the places that you get your data and being very, very careful that
you understand your data as well as you would understand any source that you would put in a
piece of journalism and that you analyze your data very carefully and through an equity lens with
the knowledge that there is no such thing as objective data or analysis, that you're always
embedding a world view and that that's OK. That's not a problem. It's unavoidable. But you need
to be mindful about what your world view is and transparent in your data story. And that
transparency needs to continue over through the interpretation and communication, particularly
for data journalism story. Choose the words that you use to tell the narrative about your results
extremely carefully in terms of how causal the implications are. And when you are building your
data is check your symbols and ask yourself whose world view? Whose ideas about reality are
being embedded into each of the symbols that you're using to create a data viz? And are, is that
world view, the one that you want to embed, or do you maybe want to make some changes to
your database?
[00:01:58] So that's essentially how to embed ethics and equity into a data journalism story. There
is no way to make it, quote unquote, bullet proof or objective. All you can do is make it intentional
and transparent.
